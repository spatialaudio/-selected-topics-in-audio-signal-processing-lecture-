# Selected Topics in Audio Signal Processing
This repository contains a collection of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks as
supplementary material to the masters course [Selected Topics in Audio Signal Processing](http://www.int.uni-rostock.de/Ausgewaehlte-Kapitel-der-digit.49.0.html) given by
[Sascha Spors](http://www.int.uni-rostock.de/Staff-Info.23+B6JmNIYXNoPWUxOTliMTNjY2U2MDcyZjJiZTI0YTc4MmFkYTE5NjQzJnR4X2pwc3RhZmZfcGkxJTVCYmFja0lkJTVEPTMmdHhfanBzdGFmZl9waTElNUJzaG93VWlkJTVEPTExMQ__.0.html), Institute of Communications Engineering, Universit√§t Rostock. You are invited to contribute by reporting errors and suggestions as
[issues](https://github.com/spatialaudio/selected-topics-in-audio-signal-processing-lecture/issues)
or directly via [Sascha.Spors@uni-rostock.de](mailto:Sascha.Spors@uni-rostock.de).

## Getting Started

The Jupyter notebooks are available

* Online as [static web pages](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/github.com/spatialaudio/selected-topics-in-audio-signal-processing-lecture/index.ipynb)
* Local (offline) use on your computer

The local use on your computer requires a local Jupyter/IPython installation. The [Anaconda distribtution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) provides a good starting point. You have to [download or clone the notebooks from Github](https://github.com/spatialaudio/selected-topics-in-audio-signal-processing-lecture). Use a [Git](http://git-scm.org/) client to clone the notebooks and then start your local Jupyter server. For manual installation of Jupyter under OS X/Linux please refer to your packet manager.
